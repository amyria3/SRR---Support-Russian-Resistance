To run the server:
node --experimental-modules src/server/server.mjs
&&
set "type": "module" in package.json

To use the flexSearch package, we would need to set the "type": "commonjs", what would break the server.

To-do: fix the server so that it can run without the experimental flag

To run devServer:
pnpm run dev

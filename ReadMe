Notes on the current stage of data-infrastructure:

////MAIN.JSX:
//initialize  context-variables for indxa & fetched Data
export const contextData = React.createContext([]);
export const currentIndexa = React.createContext({});

///CONTENT.JSX
//shares with <Search /> and <Cards /> useState variables:

...with <Search />
a. setNotSearching useState setter Function, because errors when rendering Cards depenend on if the user is Searching
b. setSearchResults to share them with cards.




To-do:

show an adequate error message when no data
fix reset when no character in search
populate DB
add keywords to indexation
fix card

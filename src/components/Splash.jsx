      A couple of people (mostly with Russian or Russian background) started this website because many people  felt the need to do something against the war.
      <br /><br />For years, left-liberal and human rights organizations in Russia have been subjected to strong pressure and repression. For the past year, this has reached a new level of escalation, so that some media and NGOs have either gone abroad, or have restricted or stopped their work due to the now widespread threat to freedom and life.
      <br /><br />Still many others continue under the aggravated conditions. Often it is women in particular who continue to choose to protest. They risk their health, their physical integrity, their perspectives in education and profession.
      <br /><br />Anti-militarist protest and any solidarity with Ukrainians is particularly dangerous. Even if civil protest alone cannot be enough to stop a mafia in possession of an army, they do help to maintain a perspective and somewhat limit the government's otherwise hardly limited room for maneuver. </p>
